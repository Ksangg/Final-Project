    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In this digital age, we carry an incredible amount of information with us everywhere. Inevitably this can lead to stress and anxiety. The purpose of Thera is to not only help reduce stress and anxiety, but also help you master and hone your life skills and help build self-confidence in the long run. The application acts as a virtual therapist by providing new sets of decks with snippets of advice on how to reduce stress, maintain a healthy lifestyle, and build confidence while providing challenges to grow your life skills.</p>
    <p>Due to heavy consumption of digital media, many people now have a shorter attention span. The use of flashcards helps you retain information faster and better and also because people are familiar with the model. A research study done in Canada states that people are more easily distracted by multiple streams of media because they find it difficult to filter out irrelevant stimuli. The minimalist design of the cards will keep the users focused and engaged, creating an enriching experience. The user gains points each day a deck is reviewed and completed, and also has the option to subscribe for more. We believe that the daily incorporation of these cards will positively impact your life in a meaningful way. </p>
